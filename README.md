# PImPL
Poorly Implemented Propositional Logic

### Acknowledgements
* _Artificial Intilligence: A Modern Approach_
  * This project was started after reading the book's chapter on propositional logic
* _Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning_
  * The book's [example code](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/), written in OCamel, was taken as further inspiration
* Online material from the University of Chicago's CMSC-16100 course (Fall 2017)
  * [The course's website](http://cmsc-16100.cs.uchicago.edu/2017/) was used as reference material
  * The note on propositional logic parsing was expecially useful, forming the basis for parsing in this project
  * I will likely swap that code out later once I have a better grasp of Haskell, but it has helped get things off the ground
* _Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!_
  * Fantastic book on learning Haskell
