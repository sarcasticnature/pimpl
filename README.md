# PImPL
Poorly Implemented Predicate Logic

### Acknowledgements
The algorithms used by this library are largely inspired by/copied from the book _Artificial Intilligence: A Modern Approach_, with some (but not all) of the implementation inspired by the book's [python reference code](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python).
